# Dialysis Of Patients Analysis

## Dashboard Overview:
The Dialysis Patient Analysis project encompasses a thorough examination of two extensive datasets, Dialysis - I & Dialysis - II, each comprising over 7,000 records in CSV format. Through this project, a comprehensive dashboard has been developed using Tableau to present key findings and insights derived from analyzing various performance indicators.

## Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to analyze patient data from dialysis centers to uncover valuable insights that can inform decision-making processes and drive improvements in patient care, operational efficiency, and financial management within these healthcare facilities.

## Data Sources:
The primary data sources for this project are dialysis-1.csv and dialysis-ii.csv, which contain detailed records of patient demographics, treatment protocols, financial transactions, and organizational performance metrics from multiple dialysis centers.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- Number of Patients across Various Summaries: Gain insights into patient distribution across different categories to understand demographic trends and resource allocation.

- Profit vs. Non-Profit Stats: Examine the financial performance and compare key metrics between profit and non-profit dialysis centers.

- Chain Organizations w.r.t. Total Performance Score as No Score: Evaluate the performance of chain organizations based on their total performance score, identifying areas for improvement.

- Dialysis Stations Stats: Analyze and visualize key metrics related to dialysis stations to identify operational trends and patterns.

- Category Text - As Expected: Assess the expected number of category texts and evaluate their impact on the dataset's integrity and accuracy.

- Average Payment Reduction Rate: Calculate and track the average rate at which payments are reduced, providing insights into cost-saving measures and financial management.

## Tools Used

- Excel
- SQL
- Tableau

## Insights and Recommendations:
Through the analysis of these key performance indicators, several insights have been uncovered, including demographic trends among patients, financial performance disparities between profit and non-profit dialysis centers, operational efficiency improvements in chain organizations, and potential areas for cost-saving measures. Recommendations include optimizing resource allocation, improving patient care protocols, and implementing strategies to enhance financial sustainability.

## Conclusion:
The Dialysis Patient Analysis project has provided valuable insights into the dynamics of patient care, operational efficiency, and financial management within dialysis centers. By leveraging data-driven analytics and visualization techniques, this project has facilitated informed decision-making processes and laid the groundwork for continuous improvement in healthcare delivery.
